# Final Milestone
My final milestone was creating a modification to my robotic arm. I decided that I wanted to make my robotic arm mobile and created a bicycle for it. I learned how to drill and dremmle. After I constructed everything and adding all my wheels on, I mounted my robotic arm on it with mounting tape. I attached a battery pack on the bicycle and that gave my robotic arm power.

# First Milestone
  
My first milestone was constructing and assmelbing my robotic arm. I first gathered all the parts provided in the kit and followed the manual in completing the harware part of the project. After I finished everything like connecting the servos and creating a base, the arms, and the claw, I had to start doing the wiring process. I wired all four servos onto the Arduino Uno on the base of my robotic arm. I then wired the controller and connected it directly to the Arduino so that it could control the servos. After both the construction and wiring of my robotic arm, I had to create the code for it. This was quite easy as some of the code was already included and I just had to change some values. After some testing and changes, my robotic arm started working with minor problems.

# Starter Project
For my starter project, I choose the Arduino Starter project. This included a Arduino Uno R3, an LEd, a button, a breadboard, and some jumper wires. My first goal was to make my LED blink with a 0.1 second delay. My second goal was to create a button that connected to that LED system so that everytime I pressed the button the LED would turn on. I did run into some problems on the way including problems with the wiring but I trouble shooted and finished my project.
